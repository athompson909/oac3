                            <!--<p>Kale, Caleb and I did a celebratory dance when we somehow managed to be the only car to have four people for our long journey. Michael insisted someone else would have to ride with us, but little did he know we would forget a few people along the way. Okay we didn't really leave anyone along the way, but we did have a miscommunication and we all left Provo without picking up Baerett. We get a text from Baerett about 20 minutes into our journey asking if anyone was coming for him. After making a couple calls it was confirmed that we had indeed left our good pal behind (with a group of 17 it was inevitable).</p>-->
                            <!--<div class="side-pic-portrait"><img src="{{article.images[0]}}"></div>-->
                            <!--<p>While we loaded up more gear in Spanish Fork someone drove back and picked Baerett up, crisis averted. We made our way down to Arizona and took a couple of pit  stops [Side Pic 1] to eat Mexican food, and take pictures by signs that say "Home of the Ho-Made Pies". The most legendary pit stop was in Paige Arizona at Walmart, where we stumbled upon some awesome footie pajamas. Michael, Matt, Kale, Caleb, and Skyler took it upon themselves to parade around wearing women's footie pajamas while Davis, Garrett and I documented everything and had some good laughs.</p>-->
                            <!--<div class="center-pic landscape"><img src="{{article.images[1]}}"></div>-->
                            <!--<p>When we started getting closer to our campsite we saw some massive bull elks, if you were to ask half asleep Kale he would tell you they were big deer, Tomato To-mah-to right? Our campsite was sweet, there were trees everywhere and it was an ideal place to put up a hammock. It was fun to see everyone work together as we set up camp at 3 in the morning. All of us shuffled around half asleep trying to be quiet so we didn’t wake up our neighbors. It was freezing, turns out it isn’t always summer in Arizona like I thought. We looked like little eskimos as we piled on all of our gear to keep warm. With 3 big tents and 3 people in hammocks we got a couple hours of sleep before we set off on our epic adventure hiking the Grand Canyon.</p>-->
                            <!--<div class="inner-article-title-bree">The Hike</div>-->
                            <!--<p>We hiked at the South Rim on the Bright Angel Trail it was a beautiful hike! I am so glad we hiked at the end of November so it wasn’t blazing hot. That would have been unbearable. It was awesome that it was cold in the morning and at night, but during the day it was nice and warm and we even broke a sweat. Back in Utah it was snowing the whole weekend so it was awesome to have one last little warm getaway.</p>-->
                            <!--<p>We all got to know each other even better as we hiked and chatted, it was sweet on the way down because it was all downhill. It was easy to walk and talk and have fun. When we got down into the bottom we realized we might not have time to make it all the way to the river and back out before dark so we thought about going to Plateau Point instead of all the way down to the river. The guys and Kimberly couldn’t part with the idea of going all the way to the river so they decided to forge ahead while Brayden, Katherine, Lia and I went to Plateau Point a shorter, alternative, yet still beautiful destination, so we could make it back before dark and have dinner ready.</p>-->
                            <!--<div class="inner-article-title-bree">Plateau Point</div>-->
                            <!--<p>Platea Point was awesome! We were so glad we chose to do that one instead. We still hiked 12.5 miles that day and I don’t know about you but I thought that was a sufficient distance. On our way back up we got passed by Matt, Ethan and Justin. They were basically running the whole thing and got back way before us. Lia and I got our second wind after we saw them and we tried to keep up, but they were so fast. We sure felt that uphill, the last few hours and miles were killer. Our legs wanted to give up, but we rode it out and made it back before dark.</p>-->
                            <!--<p>We saw so many cool plants and animals. Well I guess the animals were the usual ones, squirrels, and deer but none the less the squirrels were giant ones and I enjoyed chasing them and trying to get pictures. We had such a great day hiking and although it was difficult at times it was a beautiful hike and so worth the long drive and the many miles.</p>-->
                            <!--<div class="center-pic landscape"><img src="{{article.images[2]}}"></div>-->
                            <!--<div class="inner-article-title-bree">River Group</div>-->
                            <!--<p>For those of us who continued on to the river, we embraced a sweet challenge. A ranger who was returning from her trip down mentioned it would be near impossible to make it to the river and back before dark and that it may prove to be too dangerous. Not knowing of our supreme athleticism (haha) , she assumed we would be simply strolling down to the river. Instead, we embraced the challenge and began trotting down the trail at a light jog. Soon we were shedding jackets and rolling up our sleeves as the temperatures grew warmer and our bodies started working harder. (EDITOR’S NOTE: We never advocate nor recommend disregarding the advice of any park ranger, we only proceeded after assessing our preparedness to finish the hike in the dark). </p>-->
                            <!--<div class="side-pic-portrait"><img src="{{article.images[3]}}"></div>-->
                            <!--<p>Before we knew it we were walking through deep ocean-like sand. We looked up to steep cliff walls and rushing water. We had made it to the river in record time. The water was beautiful and regardless of the chilly november breeze, we rolled up our pants and dipped our toes in the nice Grand Canyon River water. We snapped pics, ate trail snacks, and enjoyed a few minutes with our toes in the sand. The river was quite rewarding and the descent downward was definitely worth it. How could this little river be the creator and carver of such a majestic canyon? After our quick rest we grabbed our stuff, said goodbye to the bottom of Grand Canyon and began our trot back up the mountain side.</p>-->
                            <!--<p>In a mixture of hiking, jogging, and speed walking, we found ourselves all the way back up to the top of the canyon. It was a challenge hiking out, but surrounded by good friends, dorky games, fun stories, and disney songs by Michael, we were able to hustle out of the canyon as the sun was dipping beneath the desert of Arizona.</p>-->

                            <!--<div class="side-pic-portrait"><img src="{{article.images[5]}}"></div>-->
                            <!--<p>We ate some good food while we were camping, I was so impressed with the meals our friends planned and prepared. We had omelets and oatmeal in a bag, like who thinks of that? Genius! My favorite meal was the Dutch oven pizza, yeah you heard me, pizza while camping, and it was as delicious as it sounds! [Side pic 6 ish] We all sat around the fire eating pizza, and banana boats while telling stories, it was the perfect night after a long day of hiking. A shout out to Adam and Kale for helping me to my tent that night when I fell asleep in my camp chair by the fire. Apparently I was half asleep and saying some weird things, I can’t remember much about that night, but I still get teased. (No Alcohol was consumed, just severe fatigue)  </p>-->
                            <!--<p>Sunday was awesome as we stopped at some of the lookout points and saw some great views of the Grand Canyon, boy was it a beaut! We also stopped at Horseshoe Bend on our way home. "Horrrsssshoooeee... we're going to Horrrsssseeeshhooooe!!", yeah that's what Davis would say as he did a goofy penguin waddle, that became our inside joke. Whenever we saw each other the rest of the way home we would say that to each other and waddle a little. It got me so jacked to see Horseshoe Bend, Adam and I literally ran down the trail so we could get there faster. Boy was it worth it! That view was breathtaking! Speaking of our breath being taken away, lets talk about when Michael dropped his car keys while standing right by the edge of a cliff at Horseshoe. Everyone within 20 feet gasped as we watched his keys slide a little on the rock, luckily they didn't fall! We then all laughed and pointed, poor embarrassed Michael. The keys were then turned over to Ethan for safe keeping so that we could make it home without having to hotwire the car</p>-->
                            <!--<div class="center-pic landscape"><img src="{{article.images[6]}}"></div>-->
                            <!--<p>We took a little detour so we could get a better view of Lake Powell. That is something I loved about this trip was that we took time to stop and enjoy the view, we took everything as it came and were super flexible. Even when we had a little car trouble, everyone stayed chill, the boys fixed it, and we went on our way. It was a stress free weekend off the grid and I find myself every day since saying, “take me back to Arizona!”.</p>-->
