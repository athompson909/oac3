    <p>As part of our mission to help people experience the outdoors we seek to find and review great outdoor gear that will be help enhance our follower’s outdoor experience. One product we have found that fits this to a ‘T’ is Sagan’s Journey Water Filter Bottles. These 24 oz bottles have a built-in filter meaning all you need to do is fill the bottle from whatever water source you have on hand, and drink! It’s literally that simple. No pumps to set up, no filters to maintain, just fill and drink.</p>

    <div class="inner-article-title-bree">What we liked:</div>
    <p>Honestly the biggest thing we loved about this bottle/filter is how easy it was to use and maintain. This bottle is literally one of the most convenient things we have ever used during day hikes through rivers/wet areas. A lot of filters need a lot of attention to maintain and use, but not this one. Due to the fact that the filter self-drains, and because of the filter contents, this filter can be dropped, frozen, and used until the last drop all with minimal maintenance.</p>
    <div class="inner-article-title-bree">What could be better:</div>
    <div class="side-pic-portrait"><img src="{{article.images[0]}}"></div>
    <p>The biggest downside to this bottle is its capacity. While 24 ounces of water will be more than sufficient for most short hikes, any longer hikes would require fairly immediate access to a water source (such as if you were hiking along a river) or another filter device to fill more containers since the design of the bottle does not allow you to transfer filtered water to other containers. (Editors Note: After writing, and doing some serious thinking and meditation we realized that you could put dirty water in containers then pour that water into your filter bottle thus extending the range of the bottle.)</p>
    <div class="inner-article-title-bree">Conclusion:</div>
    <p>Because of its ease of use, and small capacity this bottle is great for people who need a small filter for day-use, who are not ready to commit to maintaining a more expensive filter, or are looking for something with a minimalist profile while they hike. Those who want something more extensive or expensive should check out one of the many other filtering products Sagan has available!
